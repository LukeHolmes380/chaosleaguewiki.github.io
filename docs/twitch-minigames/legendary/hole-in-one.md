**Hole in one** is a Game similar to [How Low Can You Go](../common/how-low-can-you-go.md) with the difference, that the tile only has one row of gaps at the very bottom.

## Gameplay

Player Marbles are released into the tile, falling down towards the gaps. The center gap is giving each player passing through it 10,000 points while every other open gap won't give any points.  
There are also closed gaps with negative values of 100 and 200 points. Should a Marble land in one will the points be removed from the players score and the marble eliminated.

Falling through any gap will spawn the Marble back at the top of the tile.

The game is over once all but one player Marble got eliminated.
