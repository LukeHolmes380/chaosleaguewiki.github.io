**Zero or Hero** is a common minigame to be added in v0.9 Alpha. It is based on the YouTube version with the same name.

## Gameplay

The tile consists of 2 circles moving horizontally, a row of gaps with high point values, another 4 circles and another row of gaps.

The participating players' marbles are dropped and begin to collect points by falling through the gaps in the first row. If a marble falls through the outside gaps in the second row, it appears back in the game through the pipe at the top. If a marble falls into one of the closed gaps, it is eliminated from the game. If that gap had a skull icon, all of player's balance is transfered to the king. Otherwise, player transfers just 10 points.

When there's one marble left, the game ends and the players are ranked by their elimination order. The longest surviving player wins.
