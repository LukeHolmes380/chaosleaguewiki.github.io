**How Low Can You Go** is a common minigame added in version v0.1 Alpha. It is based on a YouTube version's tile of the same name.

## Gameplay

The tile consists of 2 circles moving horizantally, below which there are 3 rows with several gaps. Marbles of the participating players are dropped and begin to collect points by falling through the gaps. If a marble falls through the last row, it appears back in the game through the pipe at the top. If a marble falls into a closed hole, it loses given number of points, which are given to the king, and is eliminated from the game.

The game ends when there's one marble left.
