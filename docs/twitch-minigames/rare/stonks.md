**Stonks** is a minigame to be added in v0.6 Alpha.  
Sneak peeks have been shown by DoodleChaos on his Discord Server.

## Gameplay

The Player Marbles are droped into the tile, where they can fall through different gaps with point values assigned. Gaps with a green arrow will give values while gaps with red arrows subtract the number value.

If a player lands in a closed gap will they be eliminated.
