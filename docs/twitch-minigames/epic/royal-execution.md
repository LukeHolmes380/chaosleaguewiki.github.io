**Royal Execution** is a epic minigame that will be added in a future alpha version.

## Gameplay

Player Marbles are are droped into a tile which is split up into a left and right side by a large wall. A funnel area at the top with two pipes on its sides will split the player Marbles equally into each side. An arrow indicates in what direction the Marble will be moved.

Once all Marbles have been moved will a countdown start during wich the current King is able to execute the [`!left` or `!right`](../../chat-commands/twitch.md#left-and-right) command to set on what site a bar with spikes should drop.  
As soon as the countdown hits zero will the bar be dropped on the player Marbles, eliminating them and transfering 4 points for each to the King's balance.

Once player Marbles got eliminated will the surviving ones be droped towards a row of gaps. Passing a gap will give the Player of that marble points equal to the displayed value. In addition will the gap's point value increase.  
All marbles will show up back at the top and be re-funneled into the sides.

The game is over once only one player remains.
