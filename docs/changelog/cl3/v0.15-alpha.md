|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Added   | Rebellions added. Starts a rebellion when [`!rebel [bits]`][rebel-command] is used and at least 100 bits are reached. |
|         | Sound for when a rebellion ends.                                                                                      |
| Changed | Names are now truncated in leaderboards from preventing them to get too small.                                        |
|         | [`!buy` command][buy-command] is more forgiving now, accepting a space after `!buy` and before the number.            |
|         | Marble outline now changes color while you're in the rebellion area.                                                  |
|         | `Redeem tickets or bits to spawn in` changed to `Redeem tickets to spawn in`.                                         |
| Fixed   | [Quip Battle]: Typos in prompts.                                                                                      |
