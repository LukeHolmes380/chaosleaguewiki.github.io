# Twitch Tiles

Chaos League offers various tiles to participate in.

Tiles exist in two forms: [Minigame tiles](#available-minigame-tiles) and [Shop tiles](#available-shop-tiles).  
Minigame tiles give or take points from every participating player with a prize at the end being distributed to all participants with 1st plays getting 100% of the prize while everyone else gets a fraction based on their ranking.

Shop tiles allow players to buy cosmetics for their marble using gold.

No matter the type of tile, there is always one active while the other is in queue mode.

## Rarities

Each tile can have a specific rarity wich can influence certain factors of the tile such as the initial prize to earn as well as points to earn and lose.

The following rarities exist with their aproximated chance of appearance:

| Rarity    | Chance |
|-----------|-------:|
| Common    | 69%    |
| Rare      | 25%    |
| Epic      | 5%     |
| Legendary | 1%     |
