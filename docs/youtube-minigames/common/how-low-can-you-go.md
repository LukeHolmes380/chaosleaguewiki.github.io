**How Low Can You Go** is a common minigame added in version v0.1 Alpha. A [similar tile](../../twitch-tiles/minigames/how-low-can-you-go.md) has been later added in the Twitch version.

## Gameplay

The tile consists of a row of small rotating squares, below which there are 4 rows with several gaps.

The participating players' marbles are dropped and begin to collect points by falling through the gaps. If a marble falls through the last row, it appears back in the queue. If a marble falls into a closed gap, it is despawned, and the given number of points is transferred to the king's balance.
