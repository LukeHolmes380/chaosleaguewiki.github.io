# Earning Gold

Players can earn gold, a virtual currency of the game, while being king.  
This earned gold can then be used on Shop tiles to receive cosmetics in return. Currently available shop tiles are [Bubble color Shop], [Text color Shop] and [Trail Shop].

## How to obtain Gold

Players earn gold in two ways. First they will earn gold by [capturing the throne](attacking-the-king.md). And next do they earn gold passively every 15 seconds while being king.  
The amount of Gold earned is equal to the number of current viewers of the stream, meaning 15 viewers will give the king 15 gold every 15 seconds.

Additionally can players use the [`!givegold`][givegold-command] to give another player some of their own gold.
