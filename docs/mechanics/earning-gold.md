# Earning Gold

Players can earn gold, a virtual currency of the game, while being king.

Earning gold allows the player later on to buy cosmetics for their Marble from a Shop tile.  
Currently can they only buy colored trails from the [`Trail Shop` tile](../twitch-minigames/epic/trail-shop.md).

## How to obtain Gold

To earn Gold, a player needs to [capture the throne](attacking-the-king.md). Once they managed to capture the throne will they receive some gold. After this will they passively earn Gold every 15 seconds for being the king.  
The amount of Gold earned is based on the current viewer count with 1 viewer being equal to 1 Gold.
