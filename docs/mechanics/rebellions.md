Rebellion is an upcoming game mechanic where people can double the points earned for a brief moment.

## How it works

Players can use the [`!rebel [bits]`][rebel-command] command where `[bits]` is a cheer of at least 100 bits to start a rebellion. Once a rebellion starts will a circle appear around the player's marble. Every other player marble that is inside this circle will receive their points multiplied by a factor of at least 2.  
For each 100 bits given is the multiplier increased by 1.
