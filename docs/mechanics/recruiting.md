# Recruiting

One Game mechanic available in Chaos League is recruiting.

Recruiting allows a player to share a link others can use to *join* their team. Joining the recruiting player will result in 50% of all points the player earns to also be given to the recruiting player. This means if a recruited player earned 100 points will the player that recruited them receive 50 points.  
These points are not removed from the recruited player's win.

## How to recruit

To recruit, a player has to execute the [`!recruit` command](../chat-commands/twitch.md#recruit) in the stream chat. This will give them a URL that they can share with others.  
A URL is in the format `https://www.chaos-league.com/@:username` with `:username` being the handle of the player that recruits others.

This link when opened will prompt the player to authenticate with their streaming account.  
Once completed will the recruitment be announced in the stream.

A player's alliance with another player will be indicated by a small avatar of the recruiter next to the player's Marble.

Note that a player can only join one other player per stream.  
A recruiter can have multiple recruits.
