# Water and Lava Bucket

A mechanic in the game is the Water and Lava Bucket. They can be activated by filling up a progress bar for the respective bucket with bits.

## How to fill the buckets

In order to fill the buckets, one has to use the `!lava [bits]` or `!water [bits]` chat command for filling the progress bar of the lava or water bucket respectively. `[bits]` needs to replaced by the amount of bits you want to spent, using the `cheer<bits>` format.  
As an example: `!lava cheer100`

The Lava bucket needs 1000 bits while the Water Bucket only requires half that amount to be filled.  
Once either is filled will they activate in the attack tile.

Activating the lava bucket causes lava to be spread across the attack tile. Every Player Marble hitting the lava will be eliminated and lose half their points. The lava will disappear slowly over time, or can be removed directly using the Water bucket.  
Activating said water bucket will spread water across the attack tile, removing Lava in the process.

## Future Plans

This feature is to be planned to also be used without the need of having to spent bits.
