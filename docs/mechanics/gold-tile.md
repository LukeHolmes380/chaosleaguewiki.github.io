# Gold Tile

A gold tile is a game mechanic where points spent and earned are increased. It has a 1% chance of appearing on any game tile.

A gold tile is indicated by the tile having a golden-yellow border with particles moving clockwise on it.  
Any tickets spent on this tile will be increased by a factor of 10, meaning 10 tickets become 100 tickets. The same multiplier applies to all components and mechanics of a tile that give or take points from a player such as gaps, points earned by surviving a round of [Danger Zone] or getting points for votes in [Quip Battle].  
An exception to this mechanic are [Bubble Color Shop], [Text Color Shop] and [Trail Shop] where instead of multiplying, the listed gold prices receive a discount of 25%.

If a [Rebellion multiplier](rebellion.md) is used, it and the x10 multiplier of the golden tile will be added together, meaning a player inside a x5 rebellion multiplier in a golden tile will receive a x15 multiplier on any points they earn or lose.
